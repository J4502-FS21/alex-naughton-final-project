She was a close friend of Leia Organa and participated in both the Galactic Civil War and the First Order-Resistance War. She is most known for her heroic sacrifice before the Battle of Crait.

He spent his childhood as a slave on the planet Tatooine until he was discovered by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Qui-Gon and the Jedi Council believed Anakin to the "Chosen One" of prophecy who would bring balance to the force. Anakin fought in the Clone Wars alongside his fellow Jedi until he fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader. He would become Anakin Skywalker again right before his death after saving his son Luke Skywalker and defeating Emporer Palpatine.
